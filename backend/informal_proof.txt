\begin{theorem}
The square root of 2 is irrational.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
We will prove this by contradiction.

Assume that $\sqrt{2}$ is a rational number. By definition, this means we can write $\sqrt{2} = \frac{a}{b}$ where $a$ and $b$ are integers, $b \neq 0$. Furthermore, we can assume that the fraction $\frac{a}{b}$ is in its simplest form, meaning that $a$ and $b$ have no common factors other than 1.

From the equation $\sqrt{2} = \frac{a}{b}$, we can square both sides:
\[ 2 = \left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^2 = \frac{a^2}{b^2} \]

Multiplying both sides by $b^2$ gives us:
\[ a^2 = 2b^2 \]

This equation shows that $a^2$ is an even number, since it is a multiple of 2. A key property of integers is that if the square of a number is even, the number itself must also be even. (If $a$ were odd, $a^2$ would also be odd). Therefore, $a$ must be an even integer.

Since $a$ is even, it can be expressed as $a = 2k$ for some integer $k$.

Now, we substitute this expression for $a$ back into our equation $a^2 = 2b^2$:
\[ (2k)^2 = 2b^2 \]
\[ 4k^2 = 2b^2 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ 2k^2 = b^2 \]

This final equation shows that $b^2$ must be an even number, which in turn means that the integer $b$ must also be even.

So, we have concluded that $a$ is even and $b$ is even. This means they share a common factor of 2.

This conclusion contradicts our initial assumption that the fraction $\frac{a}{b}$ was in its simplest form (i.e., that $a$ and $b$ have no common factors). Since our initial assumption leads to a logical contradiction, the assumption must be false.

Therefore, $\sqrt{2}$ cannot be a rational number, and so it must be irrational.
